# Our Lady of Refuge Commerce Selling Website


## Summary

The local church, Our Lady of Refuge, envisioned a new initiative to support local businesses. Doing so by requesting to create a commerce website where community members can browse and purchase goods from nearby small businesses. This is made easier than in person because users are allowed to filter by sellers, color, price, and ect. This stands out from other selling websites as only authorized sellers will be able to login and have an account for the website by directly contacting us.
