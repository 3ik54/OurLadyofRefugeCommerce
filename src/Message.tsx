            Our Lady of Refuge is a Roman Catholic community of faithful believers striving to live the Gospel of Jesus Christ in a loving, caring, compassionate presence to all.
            We believe in the power of community, faith, and shared support. Our mission is to uplift local families within our church by providing a platform where their talents, crafts, and goods can be celebrated and purchased.
            Every item bought is more than a transaction; itâ€™s an act of love, a step toward sustainability, and a way to strengthen the bonds that hold our faith community together.
